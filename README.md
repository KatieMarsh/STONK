# StockPredictor
it will predict stock price and tell you what to do.
There are MANY flaws with my edits so use it at your own risk.

It work by using LSTM and stock indicator(well, so much for that xD) to predict the stock price on close.

The trained model I use is trained with data from 1990-01-01(1st of jan 1990) to 2019-01-01(1st of jan 2019). I evaluate the model with data from 2019-01-02 to 2021-06-25.
